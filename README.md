<h3>Description:</h3>
<p>This project is a responsive webpage perfect for banks. The goal of this project is to offer the user an opportunity to create an account, so can simulate the withdrawal and deposit actions, and be able to check the info about his/her account, and others. Please keep in mind that this is not an official website that shows up as a real banking webpage. I am just a developer who wants to showcase a cool website.</p>
<p>The website has different features. To get access to different pages of the application, the user must log in or register. Once that is done, the user will be able to explore the full webpage.</p>

<h3>Tech Stack:</h3>

<h3>How to Run the website locally:</h3>
After you clone this repository, you must follow these steps:
<ul>
    <li>Go to the folder where you cloned the repository. Copy the path of it, and open your terminal. There you need to type <strong><code>cd YOUR_PATH</code></strong> . Now go inside the <strong>Full-Stack-Banking-App</strong> folder, by doing <strong><code>cd Full-Stack-Banking-App</code></strong>. If you do <strong><code>ls</code></strong> you will be able to find the following files: <code>components dal lib models pages public styles .gitignore database.js index.js jsconfig.json LICENSE next.config.js package-lock.json package.json README.md</code></li>
    <li>Now, install the <strong>node_modules</strong> folder by typing <strong><code>npm install</code></strong></li>
    <li>Once the installation is done, create a file called <strong>.env.local</strong> There you will need to add the following environment variables like the MongoDB and Firebase keys with their values respectively. I won't share my personal keys in GitHub for security and privacy reasons.
    <li>Type <strong><code>npm run dev</code></strong></li>
    <li>Copy the URL given on the terminal, and paste it into your browser. Or for simplicity, open <a href="http://localhost:3000">http://localhost:3000</a> with your browser to see the result.</li>
</ul>
